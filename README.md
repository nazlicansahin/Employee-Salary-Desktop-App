 I made an employee salary project with JavaFx   
 If we're ready, let's get started!!   
+ Program perform Add, Search by SSN, Update by SSN CleanTextFieldsoperations.   
+ SSN text field "read only" and SSN set in the code for each record, do not take from user.   
 When program starts, read all records from random access file or text file and save each record in Employee []. (Employee array)    
+ Update both Employee [] and random access file or text file when add and update operations happen.   
+ `Add:` Select employee type from dropdown list. According to your selection, related text fields are enabled, unrelated text    fields are disabled (Search/Update SSN text field always enabled). Enter employee information into enabled text fields, then    press "add button". Your employee record will be written into file. Also add that record into your Employee[]   
+ `Search by SSN:` Enter SSN of employee whose information you want to reach, into "Search/Update SSN text field" . Press "Search bySSN button". Then all information related to the employee will be displayed, such as employee type, first name, last name, SSN, salary etc..   
+ `Update by SSN:` Enter SSN of employee whose information you want to update, into "Search/Update SSN text field". Enter other fields you want to update, then press "Update by SSN button". Employee record which is placed in file should be updated. Also, Employee[] should be updated.
